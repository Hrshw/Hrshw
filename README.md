## About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Rahul Singh Shekhawat.

ðŸ‘€ I have a strong interest in exploring the realms of PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, MySQL, DBMS, and ReactJS.

ðŸŒ± I'm on an exciting journey of continuous learning and professional growth in these languages. Additionally, I have expanded my skillset to include Node.js and Express.js, enhancing my ability to develop robust and dynamic web applications.

ðŸ“± I am passionate about technology and constantly strive to explore new updates and features in the world of smartphones. One of my hobbies is flashing custom ROMs on my phone to experience the latest advancements and functionalities. I enjoy customizing my phone, both as a way to pass the time and out of curiosity to discover new features and possibilities.
